								<h3>Cindy (Engelman) Schoeneck</h3>
								<p class="source">JSU Graduate 1979</p>
								<p>I worked in the General Operating Rooms, the GOR, at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, MD in the late 1980's. It was during the time when Dr. Patrick Walsh was making medical history for developing the nerve-sparing retro-pubic radical prostatectomy technique for resecting prostate cancer and when Dr. Ben Carson, performed cerebral hemispherectomies on children with catastrophic, intractable epilepsy and when he headed a team of surgeons to successfully separate conjoined twins from Germany who were conjoined at the head. I had the privilege of working with Dr. Carson and Dr. Walsh, and a number of other great surgeons during that time. I was there when the son of the Vice President of the United States came in through the ER after being hit by a car after an Oriole's baseball game. It was also during that time when I was given nearly 1 million dollars in cash in a paper bag. The cash was from a foreign dignitary who was being admitted into the hospital for a liver transplant and he was giving me the money required to cover the cost of the surgery and all of his post-operative follow-up care for one year. Never had I seen that amount of money and it was frightening to me to be responsible for that much money especially since Johns Hopkins is located in the intercity of Baltimore. Today it's a funny story that I frequently use when playing "two truths and a lie." </p>

								<p class="source">JSU Graduate 1979</p>
								<p>I have great memories of nursing school & have remained friends with many of those people I met back in the day!</p>
								<p>I started as a tech on 9West/Oncology at RMC & continued as an RN on the same floor when I graduated. I loved those patients, their families & the wonderful staff I worked with & am still friends with so many of those I started with when we were "baby nurses"! I got my MSN then did traveling nursing in California, worked as an Assistant Head Nurse & then a Geriatric CNS. I have worked several other jobs, but it came full circle when I moved back to Alabama & was a clinical adjunct at JSU. I can only hope that I did half the job my teachers did in the 1980s...a special thanks to that faculty & a special thank you to Brenda (Harvey) Roberts who I still see to this day!</p>
								<p>To Kendale Carroll Burgess & Pam Helms, school would not have been the same without you! Sending love to all my friends in the JSU Class of 1986!</p>

								<p class="source">JSU Graduate 1987</p>
								<p>I was a graduate of JSUs RN to BSN program in 1987. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at JSU. Just before graduating I was offered a temporary position as a clinical instructor for the community health program. This gave me my first experience as a teacher. I was preparing to Move to Hawaii that spring with my husband who was in the service then. One of my former professors knew we were in a dilemma about what to do with our 2 cocker spaniels and she asked if she and her son could adopt them so they wouldn't have to live in quarantine for 6 months alone. I felt it was an answer to prayer since they went to a loving home. I've been working in Washington DC as a lobbyist for 17 years now representing state legislators and state governments on health and human services policy, which is extremely active at present. I tell everyone that JSU is a fine institution.</p>

								<p class="source">JSU Graduate 2002</p>
								<p>My dream of wanting to become a nurse started as a little girl. I knew becoming a nurse was my dream career. After losing my Mom at the age of 15, I knew I wanted to care for patients and assist in restoring their health and bringing them comfort. My Dad was instrumental in encouraging and supporting me throughout my education. In April 2002, my dream came true. I have been a proud JSU graduate as a RN, BSN for 15 years now. I have enjoyed all of my experiences and endeavors. I began my career as a charge nurse on night shift at the small hospital in my hometown of Centre, Al. At that time, I worked the Med/Surg. unit, ICU, and occasionally worked in the ER. After several years, I grew an interest in home care and transferred to Home Health. I grew greatly in my independence in nursing while working Home Health. I met many wonderful people and experienced a wide area of different patients, families, and homes. A few years later I was offered a position as a 1st shift supervisor at CCHRC, which I accepted, and was later promoted to Unit Coordinator. I enjoyed coordinating the staff and the care of an approximately 70 bed unit for precious elderly residents for 4 years. During my time in this position, I realized I greatly missed using my skills and practicing bedside nursing. I transitioned back into Home Health for a few years again until I finally found my way back home to where my career started, at my small home town hospital in Centre, Cherokee Medical Center. I enjoy providing care to the people of my hometown and County. The people I work with are my family. So many of the people that I met and worked with at the beginning of my career continue to be my coworkers. I believe everyone has a mentor and guide in their career that have impressed upon their life and career greatly, and that person for me is Vickie Pollard Garmon. She is a graduate of the JSU nursing program at 1980. She was my preceptor in nursing school and she continues to teach me about nursing today, 15 years into my career, and 37 years into hers. JSU has given me a wonderful foundation for a great nursing career that I enjoy and love! I am a proud JSU graduate and nurse! I appreciate the opportunity to share my story.</p>

								<p class="source">JSU Graduate 1998</p>
								<p>I'm thankful for my time at JSU. Graduating from JSU has opened many doors for me. I have had the opportunity to work in Atlanta in a MICU step-down unit after school. I then later worked at UAB in their Heart and Lung Transplant ICU for over ten years. I am now at St. Vincent’s Hospital working in the Cath Lab. I have enjoyed and appreciated all the opportunities that I have been given. I would not be where I am now if it were not for the great teachers that I had at JSU.</p>

								<p class="source">JSU Graduate 2012</p>
								<p>When I got my BSN from UAB in 1985 I swore I would never go back to school. I had plans to work a little, get married, have some kids and then work part time. I only did two of those things...get married and have 2 kids. I love my job as a Labor & Deilvery nurse but I had a dream of MAYBE going back to school and hopefully teaching something in the field of nursing. I am proud of my education I got at UAB but I felt lost in the crowd of a big school. When my son went to college he choose JSU because of the band program and the friendliness and accessibility of the instructors. When I looked at JSU, I understood what he was talking about. Everyone was wonderful and did everything they could to help me achieve my goal. I graduated with my MSN in 2012 and even hung around for a couple of semesters to get my certification in nursing education. Dr Leigh Anne Keith and Dr Rebecca Peinhardt were always there during classes and projects. I was able to realize my dream of teaching as Jefferson State and UAB called me to ask to be a clinical instructor for the last two years. I could not have been able to put MSN after my name or been sought after as a clinical instructor if not for JSU. Who knows...I would love to have DNP after my name too!</p>
